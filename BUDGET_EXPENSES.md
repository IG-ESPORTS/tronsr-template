We have allocated $40,000 to cover our initial SR costs, but we would like to stress that these costs will be covered entirely by IG and only when successfully within Phase 3 of our Community Support Plan will retain a percentage for operational expenses. Our budget has been distributed as follows:

- 70% physical servers
- 20% maintenance
- 10% development
