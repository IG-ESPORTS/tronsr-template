With complete transparency, Intergalactic Gaming would like to take this opportunity to enforce that our Community Plan will be executed in three phases:

Phase One - SR Election

Phase Two – IGGenesis of the Esports Revolution

Phase Three – IG the Esports Representation on the Tron Network

## Phase 1: SR Election

Tron offers 115,200 TRX to all candidates, delivered proportionately, to the total number of votes during SR cycles every six hours. During the candidacy phase:

IG intends to distribute 100% of TRX rewards to voters; the amount of TRX voters receive will depend on the percentage of individual’s daily vote contributions.

Moreover, IG will distribute IGG equivalent to the TRX reward total to a factor of 300% to all voters, all early voters will be rewarded for their support.

For example, if you receive 10000 TRX you would also receive 30000 IGG.

## Phase 2: IGGenesis: The Esports Revolution

Success during the election process will initiate the following reward structures designed to benefit our supporters, but also to execute the next phase of IG’s vision.

85% of TRX will be distributed to voters proportioned by individual percentage of contributing votes.

IG will distribute IGG, at a rate of 150%, for every TRX rewarded, 100 TRX received by a voter will result in a further 150 IGG distributed. The percentage of IGG distributed will be reviewed on the first day of each week:

15% of TRX will be retained to establish the Intergalactic Foundation; IG will be a founding member.

## Phase 3: Esports Representation on the Tron Network

Following the completion of the first phase of our Intergalactic Gaming SR election, the following reward structure will be implemented, thus solidifying our benefit and vision to the community:

75% of TRX to be distributed to voters; TRX will be directly proportionate to the individual percentage of contributing votes.

15% of TRX to be retained by IG; IGG will be utilised to fund the Intergalactic Foundation.

10% of TRX to be retained by IG; IGG will strictly be for operational expenses of the nodes. All surplus accumulated in a side pool for distribution to be decided by community voting. Use cases required for voting could include: community distribution; system upgrades, charity donations, community competitions.

IG to distribute IGG at a rate of 100% for every TRX rewarded; IGG percentage will be reviewed on the first day of each month: 100 TRX received by a voter will result in a further 100 IGG distributed.

Please note: We anticipate passing through the first two phases quite quickly. When we reach the final phase, we may adjust the reward structure depending on the state of the landscape. We will notify all via our usual channels should the reward structure change.

# SR Plan

With over 160 SR candidates on the TRON Network, IG will need to be ranked within the top 27 candidates to become an Elected SR. This is done through TRON’s democratic consensus mechanism; Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). At the time of writing, a minimum of 138 million TRX votes, which equate to TRON Power, would be needed to successfully be elected as the 27 Super Representative. SR’s are essentially Guardians of the TRON blockchain, striving to steer the TRON Network towards innovative excellence. They provide technical governance, maintain system performance, whilst representing their community for key decisions made on the Network. TRON are yet to have an esports representative as an elected SR, which appears to be a fundamental limitation in their quest for a decentralised entertainment platform.

The TRON Network will underpin our overarching plan to digitalise and tokenise the esports ecosystem, whilst interconnecting the sub-ecosystems via our platform and our native digital token. Our plan to become an elected SR acts in synergy to IG’s vision. The value that we add as an SR is not from the rewards we provide, but rather, the value we will add to the whole Tron ecosystem.

We strongly believe that the SR function should revolve around providing real world value to the Tron blockchain. We will achieve this by adopting the esports industry onto the Tron blockchain, via our multi-faceted platform.

Intergalactic Gaming intends to run all SR operations as a non-profit venture, ensuring that maximum value is instilled back into the Tron Network and we execute our vision to its maximum potential. We thank the community for their overwhelming support.

## The Intergalactic Foundation

The Intergalactic Foundation will also be a non-profit entity that will have the key objective of executing plans that further adopts esports onto the Tron blockchain. It will utilise the TRX allocated to support aggressive plans to push gamers, teams, brands, organisations and the wider public to adopt the Tron blockchain, via IGG. The foundation will also aim to support projects in developing countries that look utilise blockchain technology to accelerate their economy.
